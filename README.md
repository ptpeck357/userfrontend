### Getting started:
1. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:ptpeck357/userfrontend.git`
2. Make sure you are on the latest version of node and yarn.
3. cd in `userfrontend` directory.
4. Run the command `yarn` or `yarn install` (same thing really).
5. Make sure the backend application is running found in this [repo](https://github.com/ptpeck357/SprintBoot). That's my bad for not including both the frontend and backend repos under one directory.
6. To start the application now, run the command `yarn start`.
